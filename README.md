## Approvals
The gem [approvals](https://github.com/kytrinyx/approvals) was used in testing.  As I was refactoring legacy code, the approvals ensured there was no undesirable behavior from the bode.  This is called a [characterization test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization_test), or Golden Master Testing.

Here is an excerpt from the approval test in gilded_rose_spec.rb

``` bash
it 'is characterized' do  
 verify do
 names = [
          'Aged Brie',
          "Backstage passes to a TAFKAL80ETC concert",
          "Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros",
          "Conjured Item",
          'Any Other Item'
        ]
        sell_ins = [-1, 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12] 
        qualities = [-1, 0, 1, 49, 50, 51]         

        items = names.product(sell_ins, qualities).map { |(name, sell_in, quality)|
          Item.new(name, sell_in, quality)
        }
 ```
The items variable uses a .product method to combine every type of **name** with every **sell_in** and **quality**.  The approvals gem creates a text file in spec > fixtures >... is_characterized.**received**.txt.

This file can be renamed is_characterized.**approved**.txt.  Each time you run rspec, a new **received**.txt will be maded and compared with the **approved**.txt.  If they match, the test passes.

The text file lists all combinations in the .product method and has 100% coverage:

``` bash
[0] "Aged Brie, -2, 1"
[1] "Aged Brie, -2, 2"
[2] "Aged Brie, -2, 3"
[3] "Aged Brie, -2, 50"
[4] "Aged Brie, -2, 50"
[5] "Aged Brie, -2, 51"
...
...
[267] "Any Other Item, 11, 48"
[268] "Any Other Item, 11, 49"
[269] "Any Other Item, 11, 50"
```
