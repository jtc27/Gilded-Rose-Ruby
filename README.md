## Installation
Clone the repository
``` bash
% git clone https://github.com/jtc27/Gilded-Rose-Ruby.git
% bundle install
```

## Approvals
The gem [approvals](https://github.com/kytrinyx/approvals) is used in testing.  As I was refactoring legacy code, the approvals ensured there was no undesirable behavior from the bode.  This is called a [characterization test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization_test), or Golden Master Testing.
